# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Added opt-in, thread-mode-checked `worker::MtWorker` access.
- The minimum supported Rust version is now 1.78 (`rust-version`), and CI checks it. The old
  value, 1.63, could never build the crate: the code uses `let`-`else` (Rust 1.65) and
  `std::os::fd` (1.66), the `bindgen` build-dependency needs 1.70, its `rustc-hash` 2.1
  dependency needs 1.77, and the committed `Cargo.lock` (format v4) needs Cargo 1.78.

## 0.1.0

- Portable `build.rs` (`UCX_PREFIX` / include+lib env vars)
- Consolidated bindgen path with offline fallback
- Example: `version_and_context`
